This is just a repository I am using to keep a ready-to-use gulp project to optimize images with imagemin

# Requirements

This tool relies on gulp 4

# Installation

```
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
```

# How to use

Put the files you want to optimize in the `src` folder. You can mix them up and insert `jpeg`, `png`, `gif` and `svg` at the same time.

run `gulp` 

The optimized files will be in the `dist` folder.

> **Note**: Don't forget to delete the files in the `src` folder after you're done.
